        <p id="dio">Dio Brando (ディオ・ブランドー, Dio Burandō), later known simply as DIO (DIOディオ), is the main antagonist of the first and third parts of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, Phantom Blood and Stardust Crusaders, as well as the first main antagonist of the series overall. He is also a postmortem primary antagonist in the sixth part of the series, Stone Ocean. Originally a man of low birth but peerless ambition, Dio is a cunning villain of little conscience and an insatiable hunger for power. After becoming a vampire, Dio sets out to conquer the world with an army of zombies at his command, bringing a lifelong feud between himself and his adoptive brother Jonathan Joestar to a head. He later becomes a Stand user wielding the all-powerful The World, and is responsible for setting many of the series's major events in motion. His legacy and influence persists throughout the first six parts of JoJo, with many characters either being related to him or inspired by his charisma and malice.
