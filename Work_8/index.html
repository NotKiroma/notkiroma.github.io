        <p>Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with gameplay that revolves
            around exploration, building, crafting, combat, survival,
            and mining, playable in both single-player and multiplayer
            modes. The game has a 2D sprite tile-based graphical
            style reminiscent of the 16-bit sprites found on the Super
            NES. The game is noted for its classic exploration-adventure
            style of gameplay, similar to games such as the Metroid series
            and Minecraft.</p>

    <div class="Development">
        <p>Development of Terraria began in January 2011 by Re-Logic, built
            on the Microsoft XNA framework and written in C#. Re-Logic was
            composed of Andrew "Redigit" Spinks, who designed and programmed the
            game; Finn Brice, who, along with Spinks, did the graphic design for
            the game. The music was composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly. The game
            was released for Windows on May 16, 2011. In December 2011, the
            game was updated to version 1.1, adding new monsters, bosses, NPCs,
            and items. The update also included improvements to the game's world
            generation technology and lighting system. In February 2012, the
            developers announced that they would not continue development but
            would release a final bug-fix patch. However, development resumed
            in 2013 with Spinks asking the community for ideas to include in
            future content updates.</p>
